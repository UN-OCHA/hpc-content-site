Humanitarian Overview site.

Language
--------

disable string translations on admin pages to keep the admin interface in the
site's default language (English) to ease proiding editorial help and defining
guidelines.

It also alters the rendering of the admin toolbar and contextual links to ensure
they also always use the site's default language.

Global language visibility
--------------------------

This module alters the `promoted` checkbox on the homepage from to indicate that
it controls the visibility of the a language across the site. (If the homepage
in a given language is published and "promoted" then the other pages in that
language are accessible to visitors, see `gho_access` as well).

Editorial flags

entities (nodes, media, paragraphs) to help managing multilingual content.


Embedded content
----------------

time to time.

Main navigation
---------------

This module provides a custom [Main navigation block](src/Plugin/Block/GhoMainMenuBlock.php)
to ensure proper access check on the node links which the default system menu
block doesn't do.

This is to ensure the menu only contains links for published and translated
nodes.
