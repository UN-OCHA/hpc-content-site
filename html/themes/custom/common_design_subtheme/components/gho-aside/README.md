Global Humanitarian Overview - Aside Component
==============================================

Styling for "aside" sections. Ex: Facts and Figures, Field stories, Interactive
graphics, Multimedia etc.

To use that component, attach the library in a twig template for example with
`{{ attach_library('common_design_subtheme/gho-aside') }}` and add the
`gho-aside` class to the containing element of your component.

Set the `gho-aside--dark` class to set a black background and change the font
color to white.

Set the `gho-aside__title` on any title field for the aside (ex: title field
for Facts and Figures or node title for Field stories).
