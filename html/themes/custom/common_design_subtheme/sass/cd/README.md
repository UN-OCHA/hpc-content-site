# Common Design

This folder has historically contained Sass for the CD, but as of CD v8 that tooling has been completely removed. What's left here are the specific files that are required to continue compiling the subtheme Sass.

If overrides are necessary for CD, please use the dedicated Drupal Library found in the following directory (relative to `common_design_subtheme` sub-theme dir):

```
components/hpc-content-cd-overrides
```
